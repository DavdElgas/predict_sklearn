# #Predictive Customer Cancellation Model for a Subscription Service
In this Jupyter notebook, I present an AI model designed to identify and quantify the key factors contributing to customer churn in a subscription-based service. This model demonstrates adeptness in leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and data analytics to solve real-world business problems. By meticulously experimenting with various machine learning algorithms, the developed model not only predicts churn with high accuracy but also provides insightful interpretations of the underlying causes. The results shown were implemented recently in a subscription based business and reduced churn by > 15%. This project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, deep understanding of predictive modeling, and an ability to translate complex data insights into actionable business strategies that produce results.
